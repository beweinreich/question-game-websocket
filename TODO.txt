- randomize choices
- send a players event after cancel so the observer shows the room - DONE
- allow for a new game after one is over (eliminate transient state)
- authors of choices are wrong (they are the same as the choosers, they should be different) - DONE
- increase the delay for showing scores and results (make them configurable)
- visually distinct the choices in the observer (like, show them in boxes, etc.)
